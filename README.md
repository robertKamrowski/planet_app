## Description

My application allows user to take a look for our solar system planets
with their amazing features. User can switch between planets easily by
click on hamburger menu (on mobile version) or just simply choose a planet
from a menu bar.

When a planet is selected, user is able to switch between three options:

- Overview
- Internal structure
- Surface geology

There are also facts like rotation time, revolution time, planet radius and average temperature.

## Technologies

My website is a single page application (SPA) written in React with styled components.
Switching between planets do not refresh the page.

## Who is this project for?

This website is for someone who would like to know a little bit more about our solar system planets.
